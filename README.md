## üìñ About The Project

Managing a vehicle rental service involves handling complex data, from vehicle availability to customer transactions. **GoRent** aims to solve this by creating a centralized, user-friendly, and secure platform that connects administrators with customers. The project focuses on providing a seamless experience for both primary user roles: the customer looking to rent, and the administrator managing the business.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or newer.
* A local database server like XAMPP, WAMP, or a standalone MySQL installation.
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support.
* Git (optional, for cloning).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GoRent.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GoRent.git)
    ```
    Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2.  **Database Setup**
    * Start the Apache and MySQL modules from your XAMPP Control Panel.
    * Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    * Create a new database named `gorent`.
    * Select the `gorent` database and go to the **Import** tab.
    * Upload the `database_schema.sql` file (you should create this file by exporting your database structure) to automatically create all the required tables (`users`, `kendaraan`, `pelanggan`, `transaksi`, `login_history`).

3.  **Configure Connection**
    * Open the project in your IDE and navigate to the `src/DatabaseConnection.java` file.
    * Adjust the database credentials if they differ from the default XAMPP setup.
    ```java
    class DatabaseConnection {
        private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/gorent";
        private static final String USER = "root"; // Change this if needed
        private static final String PASSWORD = ""; // Change this if your MySQL root user has a password

        // ... rest of the code
    }
    ```

4.  **Run the Project**
    * Locate and open the `src/Mainnn.java` file.
    * Run the `main` method from your IDE.
    * The application's login window is now live on your desktop!
